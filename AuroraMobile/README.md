# Aurora Mobile App

This is a simple React Native project that displays the [Alfe AI](https://alfe.sh) website inside a WebView.

## Requirements
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm
- [React Native CLI](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)

## Running the App

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Run on Android:
   ```bash
   npm run android
   ```
3. Run on iOS (requires Xcode on macOS):
   ```bash
   npm run ios
   ```

This project only loads the website in a WebView for now. Further features can be added later.
