This is a minimal React Native project that fetches the current temperature for a city using the [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/) APIs.

## Requirements

- [React Native CLI](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)

## Running the App

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Run on Android:
   ```bash
   npm run android
   ```
3. Run on iOS (requires Xcode on macOS):
   ```bash
   npm run ios
   ```

Enter a city name and tap **Get Weather** to display the current temperature.
