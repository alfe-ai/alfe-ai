### Environment variables

Set `HTTPS_KEY_PATH` and `HTTPS_CERT_PATH` to the SSL key and certificate files
to enable HTTPS across the included servers. If the files are missing the
services fall back to HTTP.

You can quickly obtain free certificates from Let's Encrypt by running the
`setup_certbot.sh` script. It installs Certbot and generates the key and
certificate files for the domain you specify.

### Listening on port 443 without root

The Aurora server reads its port from the `AURORA_PORT` environment variable
(default: `3000`). Binding directly to port `443` typically requires root
privileges. If you prefer to run the server as a regular user, you can forward
incoming connections from port `443` to your configured `AURORA_PORT`.

Run the helper script with `sudo` to set up the forwarding rule:

```bash
sudo ./forward_port_443.sh 3000
```

Replace `3000` with your chosen `AURORA_PORT`. After adding the rule, start the
server normally and clients can connect using `https://your-domain/` on port
`443` while the Node.js process continues to run on the higher port.
