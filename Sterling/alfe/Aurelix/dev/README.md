# API Connector Test

This directory contains our API connector (api_connector.js) and a simple manual test script (api_connector_test.js).

• To run the test script manually:  
  1. Start the server as usual:  
     node executable/server_webserver.js  

  2. In a separate terminal, run:  
     node api_connector_test.js  

• The script will make a few sample calls (e.g., createChat, createGenericChat) to check if the endpoints are responding as expected.  

• Check the console output for JSON responses.
