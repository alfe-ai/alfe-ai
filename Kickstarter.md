# Alfe AI: Open, Private, and Self-Hostable AI Platform

**Tagline:** Harness AI for image design, development, and project management—all under your control.

## Overview
Alfe AI combines three core components into a single open-source stack:
- **Alfe** – the central dashboard integrating image design and code-generation tools.
- **Aurora** – a task queue and automation server for handling image pipelines and Printify submissions.
- **Sterling** – a FOSS software development environment with integrated AI chat and GitHub workflows.

Everything is released under the Alfe AI License and available on GitHub for self-hosting or customization. The project ships with convenient deploy scripts and sample environment files to get you up and running quickly.

## The Story
**Problem**
- Creative and development teams juggle several SaaS tools, paying high fees and exposing private data.
- Proprietary AI services often retain or monetize user inputs.

**Solution**
- A unified open-source platform that lets you host your own AI design, coding, and task management stack.
- Privacy-first architecture—use the provided scripts to generate HTTPS certificates and keep traffic secure.
- Modular design: run only the components you need, from the Sterling development server to the Aurora automation queue.

**Why Now**
- Growing concerns over data privacy are pushing teams toward self-hosted AI solutions.
- Mature open-source AI models and stable diffusion tools make locally hosted AI practical.

## Key Features
- **Self-host with HTTPS** – Deploy easily via `deploy_aurelix.sh` and configure certificates using `setup_certbot.sh` as described in the README lines 14–36【F:README.md†L14-L36】.
- **Task Queue Automation** – Aurora pulls GitHub issues into an in-memory queue, letting you automate tasks using environment variables like `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, and more【F:Aurora/README.md†L1-L34】.
- **Job Queue API** – Interact with the printify pipeline from other services using the built-in Node API shown in Aurora’s docs【F:Aurora/README.md†L58-L74】.
- **FOSS Development Environment** – Sterling provides a full AI-assisted dev server with instructions for generating GitHub SSH keys and running the dev environment locally【F:Sterling/README.md†L1-L75】.
- **Cross-Platform Tools** – Scripts exist for forwarding ports without root and for running mobile clients in React Native.
