"User Content" includes any text, files, images, audio, or other data you upload or generate. You retain ownership of all User Content. By submitting User Content, you grant us a limited license to process it solely:

to deliver the requested functionality;

to maintain and improve the models only if you have opted in; and

to comply with legal obligations.
We will not use your data to train our models without your explicit consent.

5. License to Outputs

AI-generated outputs are licensed to you on an "as-is" basis subject to applicable law. You are responsible for ensuring that the use of any output complies with laws, regulations, and third-party rights.

Use the Service to violate any law or regulation.

Upload or generate unlawful, hateful, harassing, or discriminatory content.

Attempt to reverse-engineer or extract model parameters or proprietary source code.

Circumvent rate limits or security measures.

Use the Service to create or disseminate deceptive, false, or defamatory information.

AI Disclaimer: AI outputs are automatically generated and may be inaccurate. Users are solely responsible for reviewing and validating content prior to reliance or publication.

7. Privacy & Data Security

Our data-handling practices are detailed in the Privacy Policy. Key points:

Local-first inference: By default, prompts and embeddings are processed on-device.

Cloud burst (optional): Requests that exceed local model capacity may be securely relayed to our ISO-27001-certified cloud within your selected region.

Zero-log mode: Enterprise tenants may enable end-to-end encryption where we retain no readable logs.

8. Intellectual Property

We and our licensors retain all rights in the Service, including underlying software, models, and trademarks, except for User Content.

9. Subscription Plans & Payment

Paid plans auto-renew unless cancelled. Fees are non-refundable except as required by law. Taxes and exchange fees may apply.

10. Disclaimers

AI outputs may be inaccurate, biased, or otherwise unsuitable. The Service is provided "AS IS" without warranties of any kind, express or implied.

11. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, [Company] will not be liable for indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages, including lost profits or data, arising out of or related to your use of the Service.

You agree to indemnify and hold Alfe AI harmless, its affiliates, and their respective officers and employees from any claim arising out of your misuse of the Service or violation of these Terms.

We may revise these Terms by posting an updated version. Continued use after the "Last Updated" date constitutes acceptance.

15. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution
