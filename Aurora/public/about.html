  <h2>About Alfe AI</h2>
  <p>Nexum is the experimental interface for the Alfe AI project. It combines chat, code generation and task management features to assist developers.</p>
  <h3>Our Story</h3>
  <p>We started in 2022 with a task management prototype called Aurora. The idea matured into Nexum, and by May 2025 we're focusing on integrating AI tools to streamline developer workflows.</p>
