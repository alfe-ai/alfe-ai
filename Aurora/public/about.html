  <h2>About Alfe AI</h2>
  <p>Alfe AI is an open source platform that combines AI-assisted code generation, image design, and task management. The Aurora prototype provides the initial web interface and integrates with our Sterling/Nexum codebase to manage GitHub issues as tasks.</p>
  <p>The project began in 2022 as a simple task queue named Aurora. It evolved into Nexum and Sterling, focusing on privacy-first development workflows with AI tools to streamline software projects.</p>
  <p>All source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/alfe-ai/alfe-ai-Aurelix" target="_blank">GitHub</a> for self-hosting or customization.</p>
