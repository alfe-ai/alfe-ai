# Stirfry

Stirfry is an experimental component that aims to run a minimal Debian-based virtual machine directly in the browser using JavaScript. This directory contains a very early skeleton for the project.

## Project layout

- `public/` – static assets served to the browser.
- `src/` – JavaScript source code for booting the virtual machine.

## Getting started

At this stage the project is just a placeholder. A future iteration will provide a build script and integrate a WebAssembly VM capable of booting a Debian image.
