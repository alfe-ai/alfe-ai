<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>Alfe AI's code module works with the following steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Creating a temporary copy of your git repository on our server.</li>
  <li>Establishing a new branch named <code>alfe/&lt;branch number&gt;</code> for the run.</li>
  <li>Executing the AI coding agent with your prompt to implement the requested updates.</li>
  <li>Committing the modifications and pushing the branch to your git remote.</li>
</ol>
<p>After this is complete, you can view the diff of the changes and have the option to merge the changes into the parent branch on the remote.</p>
