Do not ask to commit changes, we run a script to automatically stage, commit, and push after you finish.
Do not ask anything like &#34;Do you want me to run `git commit` with a message?&#34;
Do not mention anything like &#34;The file is staged.&#34;
Python command is available via &#34;python3&#34; Python 3.11.2
Whenever you need to modify source files, skip git apply and instead programmatically read the target file, replace the desired text (or insert the new snippet) using a Python script (e.g., Path.read_text()/write_text()), then stage the changes.
When starting, please check AGENTS.md in repository root for further instructions.
