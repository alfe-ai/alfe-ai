# Nexum Experimental Interface (Release 6)

This directory contains the Nexum interface files as they appeared in the `Aurora/Aurelix/dev/main-rel6` branch (tag `2.30.52`). These files were recovered from commit `11b875fb3` and preserve the experimental chat and task management UI before it was replaced in later releases.

To try out this interface, serve the files using any web server and open `nexum.html` in a browser.
